# Lock Shop App

An interface for Web and/or Mobile for an imaginary shop with 2 doors: Front Door and Storage Room. There‚Äôs four employees. Only employees with the proper authorization can open the doors.

## Running locally

Once you have cloned the project, navigate into the directory and run the following commands:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

This will start serving the react application as well as the mock database that I have implemented with [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

## Short demo

## Thank you

Thanks for considering this project! I'd love to discuss my thoughts around different decisions I made while building the application. I really enjoyed working on it and hope you like what you see.
